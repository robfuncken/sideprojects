      Steven Paul Jobs (/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an
      American business magnate, entrepreneur, industrial designer, investor,
      and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO),
      and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of
      Pixar, a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following
      its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs
      is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of
      the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

      Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He
      was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972
      before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974
      seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism. His declassified FBI
      report states that he used marijuana and LSD while he was in college, and
      once told a reporter that taking LSD was "one of the two or three most
      important things" he had done in his life.
